# MERN-STACK-IZZY
  IN THIS PROJECT I AM GOING TO IMPLEMENT A WEB SOLUTION BASED ON MERN-STACK IN AWS

**What is MERN-STACK ?
  The MERN stack is a web development framework made up of the stack of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs. It is one of the several variants of the MEAN stack
  When you use MERN-STACK, you work with React to implement the presentation layer, Express and Node js are middle layers or the application layer, then MongoDB is to 
  create the database layer
###  Overview of DBMS Types 

**NOSQL DATABASE;

NoSQL DBMSs differ from SQL-based systems in their support for both structured and unstructured data. This allows NoSQL systems to collect and analyze data without requiring a rigidly defined schema. For example, NoSQL databases can process queries of database entities that have different elements, such as social media posts, images, audio and video, in addition to conventional text and numeric data.
It is mostly used for web applications 

**Relational database management system
Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are the most popular data model because of its user-friendly interface. It is based on normalizing data in the rows and columns of the tables. This is a viable option when you need a data storage system that is scalable, flexible, and able to manage lots of information.

understanding the difference between front end(**client-side and back end(server-side)

    CLIENT-SIDE(FRONT END )
  What is the client-server model?
Much of the Internet is based on the client-server model. In this model, user devices communicate via a network with centrally located servers to get the data they need, instead of communicating with each other. End user devices such as laptops, smartphones, and desktop computers are considered to be 'clients' of the servers, as if they were customers obtaining services from a company. Client devices send requests to the servers for webpages or applications, and the servers serve up responses
In web development, 'client side' refers to everything in a web application that is displayed or takes place on the client (end user device). This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions that an application performs within the user's browser.

  **SERVER-SIDE (BACK-END)
  Much like with client side, 'server side' means everything that happens on the server, instead of on the client. In the past, nearly all business logic ran on the server side, and this included rendering dynamic webpages, interacting with databases, identity authentication, and push notifications.
